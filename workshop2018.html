            <div class="section-text align-center mbr-fonts-style display-7">The present world can be characterized as a system of interconnected networks encouraging trade, transactions, and financial and intellectual commerce globally. To compete in a global age fraught with challenges, higher education institutions of Hong Kong need to train and nurture competent graduates capable of engaging these challenges. The University Grants Committee (UGC) sees internationalisation and engagement with Mainland China as the key to Hong Kong's future, and believes that it should be actively pursued by the UGC-funded universities.<br><br>
<div>
</div><div>PolyU, in collaboration with HKBU and HKUST, was granted by the UGC Funding Scheme for Teaching and Learning (2016-19 Triennium) for a project entitled “Fostering the Integration of Local and Non-local Students for the Enhancement of Internationalisation and Engagement with Mainland China”. The project team aims to enhance internationalization and foster integration of students from different backgrounds within the university community.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>As a kick-off from our project to inspire internationalisation within the collaborating universities, we are honoured to have invited our project consultant, Emeritus Prof. Betty Leask, to deliver a series of workshops and seminars from 19-21 March 2018. We believe that this is a great opportunity to raise the awareness, inspire discussions and creative ideas on internationalsation among all interested colleagues within the collaborating universities.</div><br><div> 
</div><div>
</div><div>We highly encourage all interested colleagues to check out the available workshops and seminars and register for the events ASAP as they are all available on a first-come-first-served basis!
